Let’s take a look at how we can structure our Sass projects. As projects grow and expand, the need to modularize our directory and file structure increases dramatically. Thus keeping our files and folders organized is crucial. We also have the added benefit of creating components that can be reused across multiple projects. There is no one “correct” structure — its entirely up to you!
This article follows on from Starting with Sass, were we learned all about the features that make Sass such a powerful tool, as well as how to setup a local Sass development environment.
